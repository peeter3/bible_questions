# Bible questions

Each Bible question comes in three different formats:

1. A question to be asked in the *Bible question* section of
the bulletin. The question always asks for the book, chapter,
and verse in the Bible where the answer is found.
2. A multiple-choice version of the question. This version
always asks for the book and chapter in the Bible where the
answer is foundâ€”it does not ask for the verse. This version
of the question will eventually be `INSERT`ed into an
SQLite database.
3. Same as 1., but this version will also be `INSERT`ed into
an SQLite database.
